A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It also describes the functionality the product needs to fulfill the needs of all stakeholders (business, users).
The specification in SRS that, I here do present is “SNAPCHAT”.
Snapchat is a mobile app that allows users to send and receive "self-destructing" photos and videos.
